## Simplicity

In today's obsessed world with the next new shiny and the general population suffering from nemania, it's time for a breath of fresh air...

"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Leonardo da Vinci

Hence the acronym: SITUS.

In other words: less is more.

"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry
