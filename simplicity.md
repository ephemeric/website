The world suffers from obsession and neomania, always looking for the next new shiny.

"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." — Leonardo da Vinci

Hence the acronym: SITUS. In other words: "less is more."

"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

### Articles

A list of meticulously curated reading materials that has been (mostly) ignored today. One needs to first consider what problems are introduced by all the "modern" solutions as opposed to what they promise to fix.

* [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix): the acme of simplicity and usability. Let us go back to 1969 and start over. An enduring OS; created by some of the best hackers that ever lived; Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, Rob Pike, Brian Kernighan et al.  

* [Eric S. Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html), one of the most influential hackers along with Richard Stallman.  

### Books

I have read more than 200 books over a twenty year period. All recommendations have been carefully considered.

[The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month): "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later."
